   Start a hyper bhop on the second platform and aim to bhop on the left side of this diamond. Once you bhop, hold jump and perform a cb with your 2nd jump button to set up a reverse wavedash ultra.

  Bhop twice on the water and grounded ultra; do the cutscene skip after this lifesaver in the background, full climbjump, and demohyper ultra out. land on the left side of the bhop platform to make the next room easier.

   \
   Do a grounded ultra from the bubble and min jump after transition. When Madeline's body is halfway lined with the platform, demo. Extended super as soon as you land on the cloud to get the most height.

   \
   Really tricky to learn at first but these cues should help. Also recommended to hold grab the whole time. After transition, wavedash and bhop off the 1st platform.

   \
   You need to line up Madeline to the platforms before performing an extended super and a demohyper respectively. After the super, line yourself up then do an extended demohyper into a buffered upright dash. Hold jump and cb with 2nd jump button. During transition, let go of jump and cb after transition.

   \
   After jumping from the bubble downdiag, go neutral until the peak of your jump then wavedash, buffer upright, and cb. You can also hold right without needing to go neutral, whichever works for you.

   Wallkick at this line and hold jump and you'll get the spikejump everytime.

   For grabbing the left side of the wall during this room, do both wallbounces very late. You want to get the wallbounce right when you get halfway past this corner, and the other wallbounce should line up.

   Fulljump when Madeline is covering the diamond in the background, then hold left after passing the other top right diamond corner.

   If you have trouble getting muscle memory for cpop, here's a cue for a general reference of when to dash.

   Hold jump on the reverse hyper until transition and hold right the entire time, and aim to do your coyote jump around here.

   \
   I find it easiest to setup this bhop with a neutral wallbounce from the previous screen, then another neutral wallbounce on the autoscroller block. Neutral wallkick and tap right lightly for at least 2 frames to land on the leftmost part of the block.

   \
   Do your extended hyper > ultra when the autoscroller block reaches this cue in the bg. Make sure you crouchjump and not buffer the jump.

   \
   Have Madeline's right foot be on the platform before starting the extended hyper to be consistent.

   \
   On entrance, do a wavedash and get 3 climbjumps to make the wind cycle and get to the bubble. Buffer both the bubble upleft and the updash and drift into the wall and climbjump. If you buffered both bubble dashes, you shouldn't ever die to the spikes before the 2nd bubble.

   Extend the super as much as possible, then hold jump and upright dash cb after passing this tree branch.

   right dash off the autoscroller block, and jump + upright anytime after this line.

   \
   When Madeline passes this line, jump + downright dash at almost the same time to get to the bubble. Make sure to hold grab while doing the jump.

   \
   Start a hyper in the previous room, buffer jump, right dash after this flower on the ground, and hyper bhop. Don't shorten the hyper bhop too much otherwise you die. This cue also works for the grounded ultra, just do a hyper bhop from previous screen and min jump.

   \
   After doing a right bubble dash, go neutral until you land on the ground, then hyper bhop and ultra, ultra. You want to coyote jump under this pillar to avoid being bonked and to also land cleanly on the platform directly under the bubble.

   \
   Hold jump after doing the reverse wavedash from the bubble and ultra at anytime while above this cue. It can be also easier to think of the bubble as just another dash.
