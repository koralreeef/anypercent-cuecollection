   this is already covered in bubs guide, but buffer wallbounce on screen 1, demohyper bhop at the peak of your height and dash upright at this coffee shop corner.

   the key here for this spring skip is to get an ultra that lands on this tile and jumping instantly. you'll know when you've gotten this with a different landing sound.
   after holding jump, down, and right through transition, you want to let go of jump after madeline has passed the spring and demo to the other spring. the ultra here requires a certain feel but these cues should push you in the right direction.

   this neutral kick is extremely feel based and hard to get down at first, but this cue might help for getting muscle memory on the right track. it also helps to get to the left side of the coin block asap as its activating.

   this is the correct height needed to get the downright cb, noted by madeline lining up with the pink space pixels. if you arent lined up, back this up with an upright dash to    get to the platform. you will die or lose more time otherwise.
