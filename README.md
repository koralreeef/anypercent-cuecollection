## Introduction
Cue and setup collections for each of the 7 levels in any%. Note that this follows current optimal route of 5b and 6b. This guide will be updated with 5a/6a in the distant future, but the focus currently is on finishing 5b/6b. 
\
I assume that the reader already knows what hypers, demohypers, supers, cornerboosts, and other important mechanics are. If you are still getting started with running Celeste and speedrunning in general, I highly suggest joining the [Celeste discord](https://discord.com/invite/celeste) and taking a look at the speedrunning section. The pinned messages in #speedrun-general and #speedrun-help are great resources for new runners and are more beneficial than this visual cue collection.
\
\
**General Note:** These aren't necessarily the fastest strats, just cues and setups that are mostly consistent and what I use. I'll be open to add other cues once I've finished my part in creating a foundation for the guide. If you have any suggestions for cues, DM me at koralðŸ‘‘#0004 on discord and I'll be happy to talk.

## Key Cycles and Misc. Terms
According to fishmcmuffins:

"For a key to enter the keyhole:

- One second (60f) must have passed since the key started moving towards the door.

- The key must be facing the door. (animation frame 4)

- The key spins slowly at all times until it's facing the door, when the speed triples. This means that for every three frames saved between entering a room with a key and putting the key in a door, one frame will be lost to the door.

- Best key opening time compared to worst key opening time is about 0.4.

- General rule of thumb with a key you save 2 frames for every 3 frames you save unless you make a better cycle."

Even though I will assume that you know general game mechanics and terminology, I think these key cycles can help for people to understand how exactly to achieve the fast key cycles shown in this guide. (2 in resort start, 1 in 2500m) If you need help in understanding these terms, the [celeste wiki](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Techniques) has some great stuff for each action you can perform in Celeste.
\
I'll shorten some terms when writing descriptions, so terms such as cb and demo refer to cornerboosting and demodashing, respectively. Other terms such as coyote will always refer to needing coyote time before a certain action.
## Formatting
This collection will be split up into different markdown files to avoid needing to load 50+ gifs at a time when checking this page. Each chapter will have its own table of contents and follow the format given below. 5A and 6A (Mirror Temple and Reflection) will have their tape segment + A-Side clear cues together, as the tape cues can be applied to the regular A-Side clear.
Attached below are some drawings of format of the guide, and you should read it as such.

## Credits
Thanks to czyys and buhbai for their github guides and being the inspiration to start my own collection of strats. Thanks to everyone who proofread or pointed out errors in the guide, I appreciate it greatly. Thanks to fishmcmuffins for giving an explanation of key cycles + offering some of the setups you see here. Thanks for reading and I hope this guide can be of help in any way.
