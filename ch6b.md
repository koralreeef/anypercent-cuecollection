   If you don't like the bhop, hold jump while doing this wavedash and dash in the middle of the two green tiles in the background to get onto the kevin.

   To get an easier bumper cycle, try to not land on the ground before the bumper. You want to get two climbjumps on this wall and jump off around the inner green tile in the background.

   \
   After jumping off the wall, hold right and slowfall into the bumper. When you dash onto the right side, stay neutral until you cross this threshold. You can hold left until you are back above the threshold and upright to the next screen.

   If you don't like the extended hyper version, this hyper bhop version as a visual cue with left dashing into the bumper at the flowers.

   At the second crumble block, going neutral before doing the wavedash helps with getting dash back. After that wavedash, dash upright after these spinners to get a clean landing.

   In this section, diagonal dashes can be implemented in almost anywhere with this gap of spinners and a dash crystal. In order to successful in pulling these off, you have to be on the side of the dash crystal that you want to go, and you must be lined up with the row of spinners.

   Do a very high right dash into the kevin, full jump neutral at almost the bottom of the block, and start holding downright once you've hit the peak of your neutral jump. If the dash line isn't lined up to the black top of the kevin, ditch the strat and do a regular jump.

   For this demo, wait until Madeline is in the center of this tiling in the background and her hair is lined up to the tiling. For the last two gaps, you can fastfall and hold left for the duration of the dash and go neutral afterwards.

   After the badeline hit, dash into the wall and hold left until you see some puffs of smoke. When you see these puffs, buffer a short hyper. At this point Madeline should be getting onto the block and will be doing the buffered hyper. If a super comes out instead of a hyper, try to input down then right first when doing the buffered hyper.

   After the first badeline hit, updash without grabbing and walk until this point. You need to then do a demohyper and jump on coyote frames. Aim to be at the bottom left of the crystal to upright dash and dodge the laser.

   \
   Wait until Madeline is just touching the dash crystal on the left. From here, you want to buffer every input of left dash > up > buffer jump > buffer hyper. You also want to be holding left until the wallkick off the falling block. After the badeline hit, downright dash and hold down after the dash. Drift right when Madeline is past the tunnel.

   To enter this room, you need to buffer a downright dash from the badeline hit, buffer a hyper, and downright dash again to slide on the floor. After the downright dash in c-04, you must let go of right and only hold down until you clear the gap.

   For the fast laser cycle, start the two left dashes when Madeline is under this pattern of the tiling. Featherboost upright and cut near the spinners to not die.

   To set up underblock, do an upright dash at this point, wait until you're at the peak of the dash, then do the double wavedash. This trick is still really hard with how feel-based it is but this setup is a good one.

   To do the inital ultra, move up a pixel and jump + downright dash at almost the same time before this green tile in the background.
   \
   When you down dash into the bumper, there are 3 launch angles that you need to watch out for. One of them is displayed above, with the solution being 3 climbjumps and a right dash.

  <img src="https://github.com/koralreeef/cuedump-anypercent/blob/main/images/option2.webp" width="384" height="216"/>
  \
  Option 1 on the left is when you get a bumper boost which is fast and good. You can just drift into the wall and right dash.
  \
  Option 2 on the right is when you hit the bumper at a diagonal angle, resulting in a slow launch. You need to upright and climb jump to save yourself.

   When launching off the second bumper, make sure to downright dash before or on this pillar to not miss the badeline hitbox.

   To make fish's strat work, you need to be horizontal with the feather above or on this point in the background. The fireball will be too low otherwise.

   To finish this strat, do a small jump and dash upright when Madeline is under the coin block. The cornerjump should be bufferable.

   To not die to badeline's laser, fastfall and hit the kevin at the bottom. Climb up and jump off when the kevin hits the wall.

   Fastfall, dash before this cutoff line and hold left for the duration of the dash, and go neutral afterwards. When Madeline is near the bumper, tap right and you should get the bumper boost.

   If you are doing the hyper bhop entry, dash late for the feather distance. If you do the cboost entry, try to dash asap.

   These cues help for doing the diagonal dashes at the right time. For keyboard players, on the second feather you want to only featherboost and just hold right. This lets you land on the feather for a better position.

   For the first cue, dodge the badeline laser when you pass this corner to have enough room for a good bumper boost into the feather. Do a downright featherboost afterwards.

   There are two different entries to this strat and I'll cover both. For the displayed above, you need to land on the ledge with a downdash, hyper and start a super in the air. Try to jump and hold it from the super before entering the next screen. You can buffer the cb then wavedash.

   \
   Start your dash through the bumper around this corner to guarantee the buffered cb off the blue block. Afterwards, do a max height extended hyper off the blue block and demo through the spinners.
   \
   ![gif](https://github.com/koralreeef/cuedump-anypercent/blob/main/images/reprieve6alt.webp)

   This is the second setup, opting for a diagonal dash into an instant super (dash + jump at same time).
