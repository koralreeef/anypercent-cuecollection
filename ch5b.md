   My method of setting up bubsdrop is through wallbouncing at a consistent height to train muscle memory. Wallbounce and hold jump at this spot, wait for the screen to stop scrolling and tap jump.

   Fulljump and kick off the wall when you see madeline's hand go above this line. Make sure to buffer the climbjump on the dash block as it will correct you and let you grab onto the block.

   Start the room with a demohyper and try to time each bubble activiation as soon as possible. Aim to dash below or in the middle of the gaps when leaving bubbles. If you find yourself falling behind in the cycle, let the last bubble activate on its own and dash left as normal.

   Dash out of the bubble after this platform and try to have madeline on the upper half of this block and climb up when you pass this mark in the spikes.

   For this cycle, set it up with a updash into the room, fall down naturally, and jump updash and instant bubble activation. Do this bubble wallbounce (similar to 4a room 2 start) around this height. Space out the dash + jump input and you don't need to climbjump off the corner, but pressing dash+jump at almost the same time calls for climbing to reach the dash block. The rest of the room should be doable with just going full speed.

   After entering the last gap in the falling room, hold downright to land safely on the hallway to the next room. Hyper on this eye cue, slide into the next room and wallbounce as soon as you leave the ground. This should setup the seeker falling into the center coin and activate the door fast.

   For this cornerjump above the button, you want to do one climbjump after the button, then two non buffered climbjumps on each wall. After passing the halfway point of this mirror, do an upright dash and you should bop the seeker and get the button.

   Hyper in and dash right on this thorn rectangle. This should give you a bop on the seeker and not a super. Make sure to not hold jump or fastfall afterwards when bopping this seeker. Dash up after bopping the seeker at any time, then hold right near it when it does its reform explosion.

   An upright dash between these two points should let the seeker drift straight into you. Buffer the cornerkick after the upright dash for safety.

   To enter the room, hyper into theo and throw him before passing the barrier. A theo ultra here should let you fly into the seeker and let you over the wall. For the second seeker, neutral kick off the wall and upright dash + throw theo at the same time. You might need to bop the seeker but in every case, you won't ever die to it.

   Hyper into theo from the previous room and do two bhops. When you reach this pillar in the background, go neutral and hold jump until around the left side of the pillar. Throw theo and dash downright to hit the button safely.

   Dash into the corner and hyper into theo again, and throw him when you get to the middle of this pillar. For the updash into the button, use the same pillar as a guide since in runs, Theo's dialogue would be covering it.

   For the last room, hyper bhop into theo or theo ultra and jump and start the regrab throw between this eye in the background and the pillar.

   Throw theo when you reach these rocks to guarantee him landing on the dash block. For the wallbounce + theo grab, make sure to throw theo first before doing a short wallbounce.
