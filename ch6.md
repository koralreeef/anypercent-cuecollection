   To setup lake skip, buffer up > upleft > upleft dashes and jump from the water. Do one climbjump on the wall and wallkick on the second jump. The cue for lake skip is lining up between these two green tiles in the background.

   Start an updash here and during the dash and wallbounce, do not hold left, only up. Make sure to buffer the jump, and only hold left after Madeline wallbounces off the tiny wall.

   To get the clean feather, you need to dash upright on the feather and featherboost upleft on the first feather to have enough speed. You can cornerboost into the room or super, both work. (or have good feather movement on analog)

 After dashing into the kevin's left side, let Madeline walk to this cue and quickly turn left and short hyper. Do two full jumps afterwards and use dashes to get to the pink block. Make sure the inital jump in the tape screen is NOT a coyote jump, otherwise you have to adjust for going too fast.
